### INVEST principle

A good user story should be
* _Independent_ (from other user stories, allowing to realize them in any order);
* _Negotiable_ (omit details that would freeze the story/API is negotiable);
* _Valuable_ (implementation delivers an increment of functionality, observable by and useful to users);
* _Estimateable_ (developers should be able to estimate its size relative to other stories);
* _Sizable_ (implementation fits in one iteration â€“ if it needs many to complete, it is an EPIC);
* _Testable_ (user must be able to check the conditions of satisfaction).
